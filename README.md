# MTAforGreenEnergy

New York's Metropolitan Transportation Agency provides extensive data sets about customers' use of the subways and trains. How can we use these data to help a green-energy company decide on where to station sign-up teams in the city?

This was my "Project Benson" in the Spring 2015 Metis Data Science Bootcamp. 

See blog post at [lucdemortier.github.io](http://lucdemortier.github.io/projects/1_benson.html) for a description of the results.

This repository contains iPython notebook **MTA_data_analysis.ipynb**, with code to analyze MTA data and make some plots.
